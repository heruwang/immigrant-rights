      <h1> Separation </h1>
  <p>The concept of this project is to express the separation of immigrant families and raising the audience’s attention to immigrant justice.
    I am closely connected to the immigrant community and care about their mental wellness.
    However, I also witnessed many broken hearts and traumatized family during the time of covid who had to suffer from separation of family. <br>
    From my research,</p>

  <h1> Invisible Wall</h1>
  <p>Distance can never be reached even through technology. Separation cannot be overcome when you remain ignorant. Separation of immigrant families is like an invisible cage both to the people who are in the cage and outside the cage. Millions of families cannot reunite. It could feel even more lonely being in the city when everyone only focuses on one’s own life and remains ignorant on injustice. Are you going to keep walking away, or pause for a second and see what is around you. Try to target the circle to the cage, you will help the immigrant families destroy the invisible wall. Are you willing to help?</p>

  <h1> Inevitable Connection</h1>
  <p>This project depicts an immersive scene of walls on the borders of the U.S. and Mexico. There are vivid flowers and plants grow in between the walls as the only connection between two sides of land. Even the tall giant wall is separating the land, however, the connection is inevitable. This project is made to help audience to realize the connection between people, nature, and love. Even politics could build wall among nations, people are still connected.<p>
