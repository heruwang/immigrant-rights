  <h1> Statement </h1>
  <p>The concept of this project is to express the separation of immigrant families and raising the audience’s attention to immigrant justice. I am closely connected to the immigrant community and care about their mental wellness. However, I also witnessed many broken hearts and traumatized family during the time of covid who had to suffer from separation of family. From my research I found that there are over 5,500 immigrant families being separated in 2019 and more are adding during 2020. The ironic truth is that most of these immigrant families have been working legally in the U.S. for years and have contributed so much in different industries such as education, agriculture, health, tech, and etc. The taxes they paid, the time they spent, and the effort they made are all for the goodness of America. However, they still need to face the brutal separation for nearly no reasons from their families. I also collected quotes from interviews that I found online to show the emotions from the families.
  <br><br>The medium I chose is A-frame. Virtual reality environments could bring emotions to life virtually and communicate with my audience through interactions. Many stories and imaginations are hard to describe with words or other mediums. However, through technology and digital formats, stories become more vivid and deliverable. By enabling interaction, users are able to explore and find the clues by themselves.
	<br><br>In “Invisible Wall”, I used a 3D modeling tool and A-frame to make a VR scene that abstractly presents the feeling of loneliness and trapness inside of an invisible wall. By implementing an interaction feature that calls the audience to act on breaking the wall, the audience felt the desperation and motivation to do more for immigrant’s rights and justice. In this case, VR creates a completely immersive environment, putting the audience in the invisible cage and helping them relate to what immigrant families would feel under these certain circumstances. Using interaction features as a call to action, I intentionally remind the audience that they could do something at the very moment when they realize the injustice. This piece is inspired by artist Aiweiwei and Lauren Anderson. Ai weiwei created a temporary structure in the central park to protest the border wall which encouraged me to bring the wall on the digital world to reach more audience. Lauren Anderson’s VR project Chalkroom created a strong visual impression by attracting the audience's eyes to follow the movement of the texts. I also utilized texts from immigrant kids' speech in my work to affect the audience's emotions in a direct way.
	<br><br>“Inevitable Connection” depicts an immersive scene of walls on the borders of the U.S. and Mexico. I drew inspiration from California professors Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello’s project seesaws at border walls. This project shows the connection between borders, people, and nature. Therefore, I chose plants and flowers as the objects to connect both sides of the wall. Even though the audience could not be at the border physically in person, through vr scene, they are able to feel the separation yet the vivid life growing in the scene.
