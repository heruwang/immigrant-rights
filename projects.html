    <h1> Invisible wall </h1>
    <p>I combined my project 1 and project 2 together to create an interactive virtual space. My idea for project one is to reflect the emotions of immigrants who are separated from their family members because of their visa restrictions. They are
      trapped in a place where they could hear the voice from their family, however, they could not get out. The floating texts are quotes from immigration family as they deeply miss their family yet unable to see them for a long time. Borders
      between countries have formed this invisible wall like a cage that restricts people’s freedom and keeps families from reuniting. Then I implement a specific background in the scene to depict an urban environment which reflects a daily basis
      scenario to most audience. The invisible wall is among us. The interaction option is provided to the audience as a call to action. The project intends to encourage people to help immigrant family protect their equal rights and prevent
      separations. </p>

    <h1> Inevitable Connection </h1>
    <p>This project depicts an immersive scene of walls on the borders of the U.S. and Mexico. There are vivid flowers and plants grow in between the walls as the only connection between two sides of land. Even the tall giant wall is separating the
      land, however, the connection is inevitable. This project is made to help audience to realize the connection between people, nature, and love. Even politics could build wall among nations, people are still connected.</p>
